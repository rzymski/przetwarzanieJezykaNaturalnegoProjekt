Parasomnia interesting premise story poorly tension logical approach cast unconvincing Patrick Kilpatrick play great role movie like Scanner Cop Open Fire Siege Eraser rest cast unknown good exception Jeffrey Combs Herbert West great animator trilogy play role like sleep little main problem action character sense story dull predictable cheap computer effect mix gory scene especially well good review average
