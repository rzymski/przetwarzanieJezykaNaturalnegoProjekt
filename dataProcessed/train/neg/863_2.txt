come realise watch Euro horror especially film cult luminary Jess Franco expect plot make sense Franco go overboard film despite surreal atmosphere film reputation director good Succubus unfortunately truly awful film get admit see american cut version run minute logic cut sure long european version boring plot woman maraud practice talk rubbish boring gore sex dull runtime take boring dialogue despite fact short film difficulty make way end location look good Franco good job surreal atmosphere positive element end Jess Franco definitely talented director classic trash film look like money overall recommend skip see director interesting work
